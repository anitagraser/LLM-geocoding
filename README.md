# LLM-geocoding
This is the code for fine-tuning Mistral, llama2, Baichuan2, and Falcon for geocodng or toponym resolution task. These models are fine-tuned to accurately estimate toponyms' full addresses (e.g., city, state, country), subsequently determining their geo-coordinates via geocoders, as shown in the figure below.
